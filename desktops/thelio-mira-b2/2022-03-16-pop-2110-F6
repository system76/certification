## Suspend

- [ ] 150 suspend successful

### Suspend notes and issues

- Resume from suspend is non-functional. After some research the issue seems to be with the intel_lpss_pci kernel module; running sudo rmmod intel_lpss_pci allows resume to work as intended.
Research brought me to this: https://forum.manjaro.org/t/suspend-problems-with-lpss-on-alder-lake-cpu/98107
