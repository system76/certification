### Displays notes and issues

- When booting an encrypted Pop install in Nvidia graphics mode, the system suspends between both the decrypt screen and the login screen as well as the login screen and the session. However, waking the system at both points with USB keyboard input results in a successful delivery to a used session. Prior products have been released with similar behaviour.

## Network and bluetooth

- [x] Wifi connects with expected performance
- [x] Ethernet connects with expected performance
- [x] Bluetooth speaker
- [x] Lock machine

### Network and bluetooth

- No notes

## Suspend & Power

- [x] Close lid - system suspends
- [x] 150 suspend successful
- [x] Perform 20 manual suspends-- keyboard/touchpad are functional on every resume.
- [x] Power on while unplugged & run stress command.
- [x] System stays suspended for at least 15 minutes on battery power, then resumes as expected.

### Suspend notes and issues

- Under an all-threads stress test on battery, the threads cap at 500 MHz - this seems like aggressive throttling, and is to be power profile agnostic.
