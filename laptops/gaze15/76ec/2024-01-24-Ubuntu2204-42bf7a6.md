### Touchpad notes and issues

- The four finger paradigm does not work on Gaze15, but this is not a regression. Further - and also not a regression - the default three finger paradigm on Ubuntu does not work once System76 packages are added. This is not a firmware issue.

## Suspend & Power

- [x] Close lid - system suspends
- [x] 150 suspend successful
- [x] Perform 20 manual suspends-- keyboard/touchpad are functional on every resume.
- [x] System stays suspended for at least 15 minutes on battery power, then resumes as expected afterwards
- [x] Power on while unplugged & run stress command.
- [x] Power on while unplugged & build the Linux kernel.
- [x] Laptop charges to full as expected (drain it to ~25% before charging)
- [ ] Laptop reaches at least a C8 power state after idling for ~10 minutes (in `powertop`, in the "Idle stats" tab, the `Pkg(HW)` column should have a C8 percentage >0%)

### Suspend notes and issues

- Due to ongoing issues around the ethernet device in certain systems, Gaze15 will only reach the C3 state in operation. This does not appear to inhibit s3 suspend, nor is it a regression with this firmware revision.
