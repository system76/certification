### Hardware compatibility notes and issues

- Failed to suspend when booted from a SATA SSD (Samsung 850 120GB) regardless of what RAM was installed. Confirmed this is a regression over currently released firmware (2021-07-20_93c2809).
- Skipped SN550 test since certification already failed on the SATA test; 

Currently has 980 Pro in Slot 1.
