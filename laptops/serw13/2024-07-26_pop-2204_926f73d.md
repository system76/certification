### Hardware compatibility notes and issues

- SN550 seemed to have a graphical glitch when booting, but something started going on with the system that looked like an LCD cable issue, even after reverting to a known-good SSD. Reseating RAM & clearing CMOS seemed to fix it. SN550 worked fine after doing that, so it's not a drive compatibility issue. Haven't been able to get it to happen again.
