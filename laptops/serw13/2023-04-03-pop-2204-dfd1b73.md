### Displays notes and issues

- Front USB-C stopped doing DP after the current firmware update. It definitely worked on the last firmware, and the port has a DisplayPort logo next to it, so I assume we expect it to work. The TB USB-C port carried DP as expected, but I haven't yet tested Thunderbolt functionality on it.
