### Hardware compatibility notes and issues

- If booted unplugged, the WD SN550 operate significantly more slowly - even after AC is reattached. Conversely, if the system is booted with AC attached, it will operate at the full and proper speed. In either case, the drive works, and doesn't have any issues outside of this. Other drives do not exhibit this behaviour.
