## Suspend & Power

- [x] Close lid - system suspends
- [ ] 150 suspend successful
- [ ] Perform 20 manual suspends-- keyboard/touchpad are functional on every resume.
- [ ] System stays suspended for at least 15 minutes on battery power, then resumes as expected afterwards
- [ ] Power on while unplugged & run stress command.
- [ ] Power on while unplugged & build the Linux kernel.
- [ ] Laptop charges to full as expected (drain it to ~25% before charging)
- [ ] Laptop reaches at least a C8 power state after idling for ~10 minutes (in `powertop`, in the "Idle stats" tab, the `Pkg(HW)` column should have a C8 percentage >0%)

### Suspend notes and issues

- I'm only seeing C1 and C2 power states in powertop.
- Trackpad is occasionally unresponsive between manual suspend and resume cycles. When this happens, suspending and resuming again seems to fix it.
