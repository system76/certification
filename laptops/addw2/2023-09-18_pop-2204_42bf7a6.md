### Suspend notes and issues

- Didn't reach C8; not a regression. (Previously went as deep as C3, now goes as deep as C7, so it's an improvement.)

### Hardware compatibility notes and issues

- A 3200 MHz RAM stick (MNSO48E82-3200E) only runs at 2933 MHz; same issue with 2x NMSO432F82-3200EA00. Not a regression from current firmware (b773ac6).
    - Updating checklist; documentation will be updated next. This is expected behavior as of last year's update.
