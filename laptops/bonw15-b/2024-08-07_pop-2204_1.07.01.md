### Displays notes and issues

- ~~Type-c DP to an external display that doesn't support thunderbolt natively needs to either be plugged in after the system powers on but before logging in to a user session, or if the display was plugged in before system powered on it can be woken up by waking up the thunderbolt controller by running lspci~~ This has been fixed by an update to [system76-power](https://github.com/pop-os/system76-power/pull/436)
- No early graphics on external displays so system does not display decryption dialog on external displays 
- laptop only reliably boots and logs in to desktop with an external display connected if internal display is open during boot, ~~also see above for additional type-c issues.~~
- HiDPI Daemon constantly changes scale or resolution in NVIDIA mode
