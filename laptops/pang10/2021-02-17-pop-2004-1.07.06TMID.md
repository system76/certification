### Ports notes and issues

- The USB-C port sometimes stops working after suspend/resume cycles. Sometimes it just takes one, and sometimes it takes a handful.

## Displays

- [x] HDMI port
- [x] HDMI port audio
- [x] Dual external display + internal
- [x] Close internal display. Monitors adjust correctly.
- [x] Reboot w/ lid closed. Decryption dialog shows on external display.

### Displays notes and issues

- When rebooting the machine with the lid closed and an external display connected, the machine suspends after I sign in at GDM.
- Decryption dialog does not show on external display unless I hit Esc twice. When rebooting with external display connected, the encryption prompt seems frozen. Sometimes I see just the gray background with nothing on it, and sometimes I see the dialog, but the cursor does not blink and placeholder symbols do not appear when I type. Typing the password and hitting enter still unlocks the drive and takes me to GDM. I believe this freeze is what prevents the dialog from showing on the external display. Since this seems like a Plymouth bug, I filed it here: https://github.com/pop-os/plymouth-theme/issues/18 .

## Network and bluetooth

- [x] Wifi connects with expected performance
- [x] Ethernet connects with expected performance
- [x] Bluetooth speaker
- [x] Lock machine

### Network and bluetooth

- No notes

## Suspend

- [x] Close lid - system suspends
- [x] Open lid - system resumes
- [x] 150 suspend successful
- [ ] System prompts and eventually suspends on depleted battery

### Suspend notes and issues

- I did not test battery depletion in this run.

## Other notes

- Power scaling now works. While running s-tui, unplugging the charger scales the frequency back, and plugging it back in scales it back up.
