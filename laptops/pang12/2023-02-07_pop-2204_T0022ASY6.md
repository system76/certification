### Suspend notes and issues

- When unplugging the charger (both barrel and USB-C) for the first time in any user session, the screen brightness dims all the way. This is annoying, but pang10 and pang11 both do the same thing. I thought it was just a U-class AMD thing but, Dev One does not have this problem.
