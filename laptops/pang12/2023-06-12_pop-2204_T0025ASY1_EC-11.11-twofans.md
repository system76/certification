# Test Platform

| Test complete | OS Version     | BIOS Version                  | EC Version | Before or after suspend |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------------------|------------|-------------------------|
| COMPLETE      | Pop!\_OS 22.04 | ARB928\_V00.01\_T0025ASY1\_ms | 11.11      | Both                    |

- Note: This is an EC update, but the BIOS is unchanged. This EC has an improved fan curve that utilizes both fans, but at slower speeds than the single fan was being used. This results in better thermal and acoustic performance.
