## Hot Keys

Note: display toggle hotkey is in the displays section below.

- [x] Mute sound (F1)
- [x] Volume down (F2)
- [x] Volume up (F3)
- [ ] Touchpad Lock (F6)
- [x] Keyboard backlight level cycle (F7, 3 levels)

### Hot key notes and issues

- Touchpad disable is not working on either test machine. It also doesn't work on the older NM16AC-R t&e unit we received.

## Touchpad

- [x] Touchpad two finger scrolling 
- [x] Tap to click
- [x] Left click
- [x] Right click
- [x] Middle click (three finger tap/click for clickpads, click both buttons simultaneously for non-clickpad)
- [x] "Right-click with click in bottom right corner..." (region click) 
- [x] Four finger swipe up or down changes workspaces

### Touchpad notes and issues

- I added the region click test here, since that may yet be set as the default on this machine.

## Ports (Non Display Related)

- [x] Left USB Type A (2x)
- [x] Right USB Type A (1x)
- [x] Left USB Type C
- [x] SD card slot
- [ ] Headphone jack
- [x] Combo jack headphones
- [x] Combo jack mic
- [ ] Internal mic
- [x] Internal speakers
- [x] Plugging in headphone or combo jack mutes internal speakers

### Ports notes and issues

- Internal mic doesn't show up in sound settings
- All headphones are detected as combo headsets, so it tries to set the mic to a device that doesn't exist. Probably just needs to be added to our headset fixup.

## Displays

- [x] HDMI port
- [ ] HDMI port audio
- [x] Type C DP
- [ ] Type C DP audio
- [ ] Dual external display + internal
- [ ] Close internal display. Monitors adjust correctly.

### Displays notes and issues

## Network and bluetooth

## Suspend & Power

- [x] Close lid - system suspends
- [ ] 150 suspend successful
- [ ] Perform 20 manual suspends-- keyboard/touchpad are functional on every resume.
- [x] System stays suspended for at least 15 minutes on battery power, then resumes as expected afterwards
- [x] Power on while unplugged & run stress command.
- [ ] Laptop charges to full as expected (drain it to ~25% before charging)

### Suspend notes and issues

- Note: I discharged the battery from ~85% to 25% so I could perform the charging test. Almost immediately when the battery hit 25%, the "low battery" alert started going off, and the percentage reported that it was at 5%. I'll do another cycle to see if this was just a fluke.
    - Addendum: I saw the other unit suddenly power off while stressing below 25%, but only once. Will continue testing.
