### Displays notes and issues

- DP/USB-C displays do not initialize on boot correctly due to underlying issues with Thunderbolt. Despite this, with the lid closed the os correctly boots, and if the display is re-plugged after the system has initialized its hardware, the external display will show the login prompt correctly, though you may need to wake the system with an external keyboard keypress, as the lack of a detected monitor combined with a closed lid can (and often does) trigger sleep depending on the timing of replugging the external display.
