### Hot key notes and issues

### Suspend notes and issues

- System will do S0ix suspend with https://github.com/pop-os/linux/pull/59, but only the power button will make it resume from suspend. Because of this and a couple other issues, we're waiting on firmware that enables S3 instead.
- Fwts suspends _seem_ to have worked with S0ix when I left it running overnight, but it behaves very strangely. When I set the delay to 1s, it still waits about 5min before it resumes. S3 suspending should fix this weirdness.
