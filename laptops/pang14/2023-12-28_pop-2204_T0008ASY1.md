### Ports notes and issues

- Combo jack occasionally detects non-combo plug as combo and sets mic-in as active input device. Not a regression from prior models. Resolved easily, either through settings, or by unplugging and re-plugging once more.``

### Network and bluetooth

- Wifi 6E AP's still don't connect, but this is not a regression with this wifi card.

## Suspend & Power

- [x] Close lid - system suspends
- [x] 150 suspend successful
- [x] Perform 20 manual suspends-- keyboard/touchpad are functional on every resume.
- [x] System stays suspended for at least 15 minutes on battery power, then resumes as expected afterwards
- [x] Power on while unplugged & run stress command.
- [x] Power on while unplugged & build the Linux kernel.
- [x] Laptop charges to full as expected (drain it to ~25% before charging)
- [ ] Laptop reaches at least a C8 power state after idling for ~10 minutes (in `powertop`, in the "Idle stats" tab, the `Pkg(HW)` column should have a C8 percentage >0%)

### Suspend notes and issues

- Powertop only shows C3, but pang14 reaches it. I assume that's the lowest pstate for this AMD chip.

## Hardware compatibility
