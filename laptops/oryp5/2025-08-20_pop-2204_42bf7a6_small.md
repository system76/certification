    - 428/406 at factory
- [X] Ethernet connects with expected performance
    - 414/508 at factory

### Network and bluetooth

- No notes

## Suspend & Power

- [X] Close lid - system suspends
- [X] 150 suspend successful
- [X] Perform 20 manual suspends-- keyboard/touchpad are functional on every resume.
- [X] System stays suspended for at least 15 minutes on battery power, then resumes as expected afterwards
- [X] Power on while unplugged & run stress command.
- [X] Power on while unplugged & build the Linux kernel.
- [X] Laptop charges to full as expected (drain it to ~25% before charging)
- [ ] Laptop reaches at least a C8 power state after idling for ~10 minutes (in `powertop`, in the "Idle stats" tab, the `Pkg(HW)` column should have a C8 percentage >0%)

### Suspend notes and issues

- powertop only shows Pkg C2 and C3 getting percentages after idling.
    - Not a regression (same behavior on proprietary firmware).

### Hardware compatibility notes and issues

- oryp5 shipped with 2666 MHz (up to 64GB) or 3000 (up to 32GB) RAM.
    - We have no 3000 MHz DDR4 SO-DIMM RAM in the lab.
    - 64GB (2x32GB) of 2666 MHz works at 2666 MHz.
    - 32GB (2x16GB) of 2933 MHz works at 2933 MHz.
    - 16GB (2x8GB) of 3200 MHz works at 3200 MHz.
    - 16GB (1x16GB) of 3200 MHz works at 3200 MHz.
        - Don't have a second DIMM in the lab to test a pair.
    - 32GB (1x32GB) of 3200 MHz works at 3200 MHz.
        - Don't have a second DIMM in the lab to test a pair.
    - 48GB (32GB + 16GB) of 3200 MHz works at 3200 MHz. 
    - Conclusion: while I can't test the exact maximum spec, RAM works on this firmware beyond the maximum spec.
