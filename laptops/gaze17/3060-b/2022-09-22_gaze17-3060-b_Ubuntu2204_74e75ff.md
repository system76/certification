### Touchpad notes and issues

- While present, Four-finger gestures are almost entirely unresponsive. Across more than 30 attempts, only two efforts at swiping between workspaces detected the gesture lone enough to successfully complete. However, this is not a firmware-related error. It is present in both the 090f9e0 release, and this proposed 74e75ff release. This is not a Gaze17 specific issue either.
