### Displays notes and issues

- Though not a regression, the launcher is less responsive when the laptop is closed and an external display is used. That is, while the `super` key can be pressed - and that key press registered - occassionally the mapped `super` key function does not launch. However, the `super` + `d`, `super` + `a`, and `super` + `/` shortcuts work without any apparent issue. This isn't a regression, and should be minimally impactful to users.
- Certain monitors will not correctly display when connected via HDMI. This is not a regression. Lab monitors which displayed (excuse the pun) this behaviour included the Viewsonic 2770-LED and 2780-4k, the newer of which was released in 2015. The 2757 and 2771 function, the former of which was released in 2016. This warrants investigation around changing standards.
